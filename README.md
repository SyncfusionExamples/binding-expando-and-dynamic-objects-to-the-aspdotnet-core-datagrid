# Binding Expando and Dynamic Objects to the ASP.NET Core DataGrid Control

A quick start ASP.NET Core web application demonstrating how to bind a dynamic list of objects using Expando and Dynamic Objects using Grid Control.

* `ExpandoObject`: Allows dynamic members to be added or removed at runtime, useful for binding data to a Data Grid without a predefined model.
* `DynamicObject`: Enables runtime definition of object structure and behavior by inheriting from DynamicObject and overriding methods like TryGetMember, TrySetMember, and GetDynamicMemberNames.
